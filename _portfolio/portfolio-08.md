1. Platoon Control System:  
Designed and calibrated brake-by-wire systems for synchronized automous control platooning.  
Implemented IDM (Intelligent Driver Model) with adaptive parameters for highway car-following.  
1. Field Validation:  
Conducted highway platoon tests under mixed traffic.  
Leverage V2V (DSRC/C-V2X) for cohesive platoon behavior.
