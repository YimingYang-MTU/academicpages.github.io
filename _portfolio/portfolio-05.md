1. Visualizing agent dynamics (position, velocity, yaw) alongside road markings and boundaries.  
2. Extracting lane geometries (IDs, shapes) to map connectivity.  
3. Identifying conflict points at intersections using trajectory overlaps.  
4. Generating lane polygons for precise map-matching.  
This pipeline transforms raw perception data into actionable insights for collision risk assessment and infrastructure design.
