title: " Microscopic Traffic Safety Analysis"
excerpt: "Leveraging Waymo's sensor data, I conducted a granular safety analysis by:<br/>
1. Visualizing agent dynamics (position, velocity, yaw) alongside road markings and boundaries;<br/>
2. Extracting lane geometries (IDs, shapes) to map connectivity;<br/>
3. Identifying conflict points at intersections using trajectory overlaps; and<br/>
4. Generating lane polygons for precise map-matching.<br/>
This pipeline transforms raw perception data into actionable insights for collision risk assessment and infrastructure design.<br/>
