- **Project overview**: The Railroad Crossing Vehicle Warning (RCVW) system, developed by Michigan Tech, Battelle, and 2nd Sandbar Productions, demonstrated how connected vehicle technology can improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings (HRGCs). Through four live events and virtual demonstrations, the team showcased RCVW’s potential to reduce fatalities by alerting drivers of approaching trains. Field tests in Michigan included instrumented crossings and vehicles, while simulations in V2I Hub and VISSIM modeled real-world interactions. All materials—videos, simulations, and educational resources—were shared via the Rail Learning System (RLS) and FRA website to support industry adoption. This project aligns with the national goal of zero fatalities at HRGCs by proving the lifesaving potential of connected vehicle tech.
- **Role**: Research Assistant 
- **Tools**: V2I hub, VISSIM, Ublox GPS application board, C++  
- **Contributions 1**:  
  System development: provided real-time RTK positioning to VBS by retrieving and processing RTCM correction data from MDOT’s CORS NTRIP network. Created high-precision HRGCs maps to support RCVW system validation. Configured VBS/RBS/RSU and software protocols for V2X communication.

- **Contributions 2**:  
  Virtual demonstrations for [Railroad   Crossing Violation Warning (RCVW)](https://www.rail-learning.mtu.edu/rcvw) Application with Connected Vehicles in [Rail Learning System](https://www.rail-learning.mtu.edu/), which is an open learning platform that initially provides basic education on high speed rail topics.

- **Contributions 3**:  
  This simulation were developed in V2I Hub (with RBS/VBS plugins, RSU, OBU, GPS, DVI, and computing platforms) and VISSIM. In V2I Hub, we simulated an RCVW-equipped vehicle passing a grade crossing for four use cases. VISSIM added background traffic and train interactions, showing dynamic vehicle responses to RSU messages and train crossings. Videos from both simulators were recorded and integrated for demonstration.

- **Contributions 4**:  
  At the Michigan Rail Conference (Escanaba, MI), we staged a demo route in a parking lot, including an illustrative grade crossing with active warning devices (flashing lights). After a pre-event site visit to establish the route and MAP, attendees experienced rides in RCVW-equipped vehicles.

- **Contributions 5**:  
  Two-day field demonstration at two HRGCs in Crystal Falls, Michigan (a gated county road and a state highway with flashing lights), instrumented for RCVW testing. A pre-event visit ensured proper site mapping and communication protocols.
