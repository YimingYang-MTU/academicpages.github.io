1. CAN Bus Communication:<br/>
Developed STM32-based CAN protocols for real-time data exchange between autonomous systems and EV components.<br/>
2. Drive-by-Wire Calibration:<br/>
Engineered precise control algorithms for steering (EPS), propuslsion, and brake systems, ensuring compliance with autonomous driving requirements.<br/>
3. Electrification Transition:<br/>
Led hardware/software adaptation to migrate from gasoline to EV architecture, resolving high-voltage safety and signal compatibility challenges.<br/>
