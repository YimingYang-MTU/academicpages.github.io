1. CAN Bus Communication:  
Developed an STM32-based CAN protocol for real-time data exchange between autonomous systems and EV components.  
2. Drive-by-Wire Calibration:  
Engineered precise control algorithms for electric power steering (EPS), propulsion, and braking systems, ensuring compliance with autonomous driving requirements.  
3. Electrification Transition:  
Led hardware/software adaptation efforts to transition from gasoline to EV architecture, resolving compatibility challenges.
