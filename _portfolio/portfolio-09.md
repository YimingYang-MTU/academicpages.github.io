1. Designed and implemented a motion-control system, including throttle-by-wire, brake-by-wire (pump pressure control), and steer-by-wire systems for precise vehicle actuation. Developed incremental PID control algorithms for smooth and responsive dynamic adjustments.

2. Designed a safety-critical remote controller with: real-time motion override capability (throttle/brake/steering) and an emergency stop (E-stop).

3. Designed a robust power supply system for: the microcontroller, sensor suite (LiDAR, GPS, IMU, cameras), and remote control receiver.
