- **Project overview**: Unmanned/uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) offer advanced capabilities for transportation infrastructure monitoring and condition assessment. This Phase 3 project explored four UAS use cases—traffic operations, bridge inspection, construction inspection, and LiDAR-based design surveys—and their integration into MDOT databases and workflows. Field data collections across Michigan demonstrated how UAS methods generate high-resolution geospatial outputs for MDOT operations. Project report can be found [here](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/62974#:~:text=This%20Phase%203%20project%20focused,lidar%20UAS%20for%20design%20survey.). Key results included:  
1. Traffic Operations: Origin-destination analysis and    traffic counts.  
2. Bridge Inspection: Automated detection of spalls/delaminations and 3D bridge models.  
3. Construction Inspection: Production rates for concrete/asphalt work and BIM data.  
4. LiDAR Surveys: High-resolution 3D models for design surveys.
