## Overview ##
The Robust Autonomous Systems Laboratory (RASL) focusses on research that improves autonomous systemsâ€™ ability to operate in adverse conditions. As we push these systems to their limits, we become well acquainted with their range of functionality. Measurement science, standards, and technology is necessary for defining this range. Our experience with pushing the envelope makes us uniquely poised to work with NIST in enabling robust autonomous systems.
