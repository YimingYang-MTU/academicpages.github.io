## Motivation ##

In cold and snowy regions, vehicles encounter low-friction, non-uniform road surfaces, significantly complicating control dynamics. Manual driving under these conditions becomes highly demanding and risk-prone, as traction loss and unpredictable terrain degrade stability and maneuverability. To systematically investigate these challenges, this study explores two critical questions:  
1. What are the performance limits of vehicle motion on snow and ice when operating at the edge of handling?  
2. How much does performance degrade on low-friction surfaces compared to dirt?  

## Testing platform ##

It’s built based on a 1:5 scale Baja 5B RC car. Ublox c099-F9P GPS and Lord 3DM-GX3-25 IMU are selected for localization. The GPS Antenna is located on a 3D-printed support bracket at the rear of the car so as not to be obscured by other parts. The IMU is mounted on rubber bumpers on a sturdy metal plate inside the middle of the car. To get an RTK GPS signal, a 4G hotspot is attached to the front of the shell, Real Time Correction Messages (RTCM) can be received to enable RTK measurement.

## Vehicle dynamics ##

It’s hard to measure or estimate the parameters of a high-fidelity vehicle model. We follow the same modeling process in AutoRally, a fully connected neural network to represent the vehicle dynamics.

## Controller ##

Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) is a sampling-based controller that can handle discontinuous cost functions. Unlike gradient-based methods, it does not rely on derivatives, enabling compatibility with a wide variety of system dynamics—including neural networks.
