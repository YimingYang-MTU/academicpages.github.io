- **Abstract**:  
This work presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for vehicle platoon control in highways, addressing two key challenges: continuous precise control and string stability. We develop a DRL strategy that optimizes spacing, velocity, and acceleration through:  
1. A multi-objective reward function balancing spacing error, velocity deviation, and acceleration limits  
2. A Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm combining actor-critic and deep Q-learning for continuous state-action control
3. Validation showing comparable accuracy to distributed MPC, with faster response  
Simulations demonstrate superior learning effectiveness, control precision, and platoon stability â€“ advancing next-gen transportation systems through AI-driven automation.

- **Methods**:  
  We proposed two training frameworks for two communication topologies: predecessor following (PF) and predecessor-leader following (PLF)

- **Results**:  
  We applied the proposed methods to PF and PLF, and compared the Velocity, acceleration, space error, and velocity error of PF and PLF topology.
